    <p>When you take a photo with your smartphone or digital camera, it embeds hidden data called EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) into the image file. While this metadata can be useful for organizing photos, it can also pose serious privacy risks when shared online.</p>
    
    <h3>What is EXIF Data?</h3>
    <p>EXIF data includes information such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GPS coordinates (exact location where the photo was taken)</li>
        <li>Date and time the photo was taken</li>
        <li>Camera make and model</li>
        <li>Camera settings (aperture, shutter speed, ISO)</li>
        <li>Software used to edit the image</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Privacy Risks of Sharing EXIF Data</h3>
    <p>When you share photos online without removing EXIF data, you may unknowingly reveal sensitive information:</p>
    
    <h4>1. Location Tracking</h4>
    <p>The most significant risk is GPS coordinates embedded in photos. Anyone with access to the image file can extract these coordinates to determine exactly where the photo was taken, potentially compromising your home address, workplace, or vacation destinations.</p>
    
    <h4>2. Personal Information Exposure</h4>
    <p>EXIF data can reveal patterns in your daily routine, such as when you typically take photos, which might indicate when you're away from home.</p>
    
    <h4>3. Device Fingerprinting</h4>
    <p>Camera model and settings information can be used to identify your specific device, creating a digital fingerprint that can track your activity across different platforms.</p>
    
    <h3>How to Protect Yourself</h3>
    <p>To protect your privacy when sharing photos online:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Always remove EXIF data before uploading images to social media</li>
        <li>Use privacy-focused tools like our EXIF Scrubber to automatically strip metadata</li>
